      <h2>Message From Dean</h2>
      <p>“ Welcome to Islamic University of Maldives, Center for Research and Publication. This Center serves as the focal point for research in IUM and therefore, plays a key role in promoting and facilitating research in the University as well as in the wider Maldivian community. In today’s global environment, research is integral for decision making at various levels especially in most developed countries.  Many reputable universities across the world places considerable importance on conducting research. However, research and evidence based decision making is fairly new to the Maldives but the government and the people of Maldives have realized the importance of making informed decisions based on top quality research. The effort many Maldivian higher education institutions are putting into promoting research is a clear indication of this.</p><br>
      <p>The nature of research activity determines an institution’s priorities, their intellectual capacity as well the climate.  In Islamic University of Maldives, we understand the contribution research can make on student and staff learning, how it can promote innovation and the potential it has for supporting moderation and unification which are the three basic principles the University seeks to promote. Center for Research and Publication hopes to contribute to the society by creating a body of knowledge informed by research to address some of the most contested religious and societal issues that presently plague our community. In order to achieve this, the Center primarily focuses on encouraging a culture in which students are taught various disciplines not just for themselves but to disseminate the knowledge they gain through research. This is necessary to create a productive research environment in the University. We, at the Center for Research and Publication are enthusiastic to see our students and staff engage in discovery and exploration of knowledge through top quality research and redefine service to community. May Allah bless us to achieve our goals.</p>
