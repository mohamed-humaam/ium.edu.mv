  message: `السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته\n\nIn my 13 years of teaching career, I have learnt that among many others, teaching is one of the noblest professions. It is a profession where after each lesson, you feel content that you have done something worthwhile to change the mindset of at least one student in the class.  As teachers, we not only teach the subject matter, but also teach our students, Islamic values and ethics that lead to their good character building. \n\nIn the past 5 years, Kulliyyah of Education (KED) has spread its programmes to many corners of the Maldives, allowing a wide range of students in the country to take part in teacher training. We believe that every student is different, and every student should have the opportunity to climb the higher education ladder even if it is starting at the foundation level. We teach students to explore their hidden ability with the guidance of their teachers.  These students then spread their knowledge at their work environment and transfer this knowledge to their own students creating a network of learners.\n\nMany may ask about the uniqueness of the programmes offered at KED. All the programmes offered here are blended with Islamic and contemporary knowledge. We believe in producing graduates that are successful in this world and the hereafter. We not only educate minds, but also inculcate Islamic values so as to nurture their souls. These graduates, as meaningful beings, uplift and motivate others in doing good, and spread natural sense of altruism and care for others in the society.`,

const KED_Intro = "Kulliyyah of Education is driven by the core values; integration of knowledge, promoting thinking skills, cultivating an Islamic culture, and conducting educational research.
