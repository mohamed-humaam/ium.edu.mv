      <h2>Message From Dean</h2>
      <p class="arabic">"السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته</p><br>

      <p>In my 13 years of teaching career, I have learnt that among many others, teaching is one of the noblest professions. It is a profession where after each lesson, you feel content that you have done something worthwhile to change the mindset of at least one student in the class.  As teachers, we not only teach the subject matter, but also teach our students, Islamic values and ethics that lead to their good character building.</p><br>
        
      <p>In the past 5 years, Kulliyyah of Education (KED) has spread its programmes to many corners of the Maldives, allowing a wide range of students in the country to take part in teacher training. We believe that every student is different, and every student should have the opportunity to climb the higher education ladder even if it is starting at the foundation level. We teach students to explore their hidden ability with the guidance of their teachers.  These students then spread their knowledge at their work environment and transfer this knowledge to their own students creating a network of learners.</p><br>
        
      <p>Many may ask about the uniqueness of the programmes offered at KED. All the programmes offered here are blended with Islamic and contemporary knowledge. We believe in producing graduates that are successful in this world and the hereafter. We not only educate minds, but also inculcate Islamic values so as to nurture their souls. These graduates, as meaningful beings, uplift and motivate others in doing good, and spread natural sense of altruism and care for others in the society."</p><br>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Kulliyyah of Education is driven by the core values; integration of knowledge, promoting thinking skills, cultivating an Islamic culture, and conducting educational research. We believe that it is through education that one can nurture and instill the Islamic values, to develop a well-rounded human being.</p><br>
    <p>CCE prepares the students for entry into higher education by giving them a solid foundation in the areas of their choice. CCE currently prepares students to undertake courses in the areas of Quranic Studies, Shari’ah and Law, English Language, Business Management, Imaamship and Teaching. All programs which prepare students for undergraduate studies are one-year long and comprises of two semesters that will prepare students for a smooth transition to university studies.</p><br>
    <p>In addition, CCE provides courses for adult or mature learners and other prospective students who may be interested in doing short courses. These courses are ranged from certificate levels 1 to 3 and include areas such as Qira’ath al-Quran, English Language and Imaamship. These courses have a duration of one semester or less in a few courses.</p><br>
    <p>We concentrate in providing educational opportunities to all. We strive for equity in education, through tailor made courses. Our courses focus on developing educational leaders equipped with both Islamic and contemporary knowledge, and skills.</p><br>
    <p>Our academic staff comprises lecturers with diverse real-world experience in the teaching profession, who inspires and motivates students to achieve excellence in their academic pursuit. We are geared towards conducting research in various fields of education. Through high-level research and publication, we believe we would be recognized in the global world in the near future. Through collaboration and exchange programmes with other universities, we look forward in making Kulliyyah of Education one of the best teacher training provider In Sha Allah.</p>
