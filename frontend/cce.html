  <section id="intro">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Centre for Continuing Education was established in December 2018 after merging Centre for Foundation Studies and Language Learning Centre. The objective of establishing CCE was providing university preparation programs for students pursuing undergraduate studies and managing and coordinating all academic programs of the university in the IUM Learning Centres established in the atolls. However, in January 2020, management of administrative tasks and academic coordination of academic programs have been handed over to IUM Holdings Private Limited and the respective Kulliyahs/Centres.  

CCE prepares the students for entry into higher education by giving them a solid foundation in the areas of their choice. CCE currently prepares students to undertake courses in the areas of Quranic Studies, Shari’ah and Law, English Language, Business Management, Imaamship and Teaching. All programs which prepare students for undergraduate studies are one-year long and comprises of two semesters that will prepare students for a smooth transition to university studies.

In addition, CCE provides courses for adult or mature learners and other prospective students who may be interested in doing short courses. These courses are ranged from certificate levels 1 to 3 and include areas such as Qira’ath al-Quran, English Language and Imaamship. These courses have a duration of one semester or less in a few courses.

English language courses offered at CCE are aimed for adult learners who do not have an English language background. These programs range from certificate levels 1 to 3 and beginning with the use of language for basic needs and extending to the use of language for general purposes in a range of contexts. We also offer a certificate level 4 English language program relevant to the hospitality industry. It teaches the basic communication skills needed to communicate in a variety of different work situations in the tourism industry.

Further, students at this centre will experience learning in a university learning environment and develop their self-esteem through the activities conducted at the university.</p>
